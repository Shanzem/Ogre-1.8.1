		Notes :-

Updated 25/04/2018

Playable demo. :)

OIS setup. now have a user input system.

Chase camera setup!

Mouse node movement no go currently.

To google.


-------------------------------------------------------------


		Play with me guide :-
		
Download bloodshed Dev++ 5.11 or greater.
Install to its default path.
Run dev, choose your preferred views.
close dev. 

Download MSYS (NOT 2) use the GUI installer and install the mingw compiler set.

Thats it for programs.

		
Create a new folder in your drive C:\ called "ogre" (case sensitive) LOWER CASE!
So if you open C:\ you see an ogre folder.

download pre built 1.8.1 from my google drive :-


extract OgreSDK_MinGW_v1-8-1 content to C:\ogre. so now you have C:\ogre\OgreSDK_MinGW_v1-8-1 in a folder.

download this package - top right as zip
extract to C:\ogre. so you have a directory like this :-

Directory of C:\ogre

open project "ogreproject.dev"

right click on ogreproject in projects tab on left hand side, click project options.

Click on parameters tab. click on "add library or object". button bottom right.

navigate to C:\ogre\OgreSDK_MinGW_v1-8-1\lib\release and add 


OgreSDK_MinGW_v1-8-1/lib/release/libOgreMain.dll.a
OgreSDK_MinGW_v1-8-1/lib/release/libOgrePaging.dll.a
OgreSDK_MinGW_v1-8-1/lib/release/libOgreProperty.dll.a

OgreSDK_MinGW_v1-8-1/lib/release/libOgreTerrain.dll.a
OgreSDK_MinGW_v1-8-1/lib/release/libOIS.dll.a

Do again add :-

C:\ogre\OgreSDK_MinGW_v1-8-1/lib\release\opt and add

OgreSDK_MinGW_v1-8-1/lib/release/opt/libPlugin_BSPSceneManager.dll.a

Goto 

Ogre::String lDirectoryToLoad = "C:/Users/Luke/Desktop/ogre/ogre.1.8.1";

to

Ogre::String lDirectoryToLoad = "C:/ogre";


If you done this correctly hitting compile and run in Dev++ will show a screen called.

"First setup 0.1 WIP"

Display mesh's and also apply textures to them.

and should create a "Important_information.LOG" in C:\ogre

FIN :).


		System requirements / My constraints :-
		
Windows / Linux	/ Raspberry PI
		
1Ghz 			Intel/Arm/Amd

500(+20?)MB		Ram				

64MB 			Graphics card supporting GL* integrated or better.

*GLES2 OR 3 depends need to do some research.

The Small Box

The small box gets its first teeth
And its small length
Its small width and small emptiness
And all that it has got

The small box is growing bigger
And now the cupboard is in it
That it was in before

And it grows bigger and bigger and bigger
And now it has in it the room
And the house and the town and the land
And the world it was in before

The small box remembers its childhood
And by overgreat longing
It becomes a small box again

Now in the small box
Is the whole world quite tiny
You can easily put it in a pocket
Easily steal it easily lose it

Take care of the small box

----------------------------------------------------------------------


	What i have in the box currently/What i am using :-
		
Ogre 1.8.1							Running in Dev++
ogreproject.exe						Test window, produces .log contain all loads
OPENGL								Tested and works	-	Enabled
DirectX9							Tested and works	-	Disabled
FreeImage 							version: 3.15.3
ParticleFX							Need documentation
BSPSceneManager						Works					- Not using but keeping support
CgProgramManager
PCZSceneManager						Need documentation
OctreeZone							Need documentation
OctreeSceneManager					Need documentation
GTK Radiant(Q3) map editor			Installed,running :)	- Not using but keeping support
Q3map2 map-> bsp compiler			Installed,works			- Not using but keeping support
Krita 4.0							All artwork
Blender	2.75						All models
Blender2ogre 6						WORKS
Ogre meshy							Bone weights and useful information
OgreCommandLineTools_1.7.2			OgreXMLconverter,MeshMagick,MeshUpgrader.
Ogre Particle Lab					Nifty app :)
Ogre paged geometry					Raw - Trees/rocks/bushs in a bounding box.


		Still needed :-

OgreODE								Physics engine. For easy collision setup.
									Need OgreODE.
									
Resource manager .pk3/.zip.wad		For compressing READ only data.
									
									
Navmap plugin	 					Identify scenes changes / loads for player. A.I movement, patrols route to player without
									getting stuck.

MySql lite plugin					Database, items, saves, NPC stats, the bread and butter at the fancy restaurant.
(Open source equivalent) 			Always wanted to learn SQL, now is my chance!						
									
																		
LUA plugin							A.I Scripting, camera events,tutorial,cut scene.
									Like jass from warcraft 3 map editor :)
									Bet that is its origins.

Sound plugin(raw)					Not researched much, OpenAL is one option.

Movie plugin						Ogre forums mentioned "A" plugin, plays video. no sound played, but file must contain sound!.
									Hopefully this is cured/altered made sane :).

Mesh viewer							I have vowed to make this myself as a side project.
									Using imgui and ogre engine to load and render a mesh in GL/DX9 and include textures/wireframe
									to test defects and check mesh bones and animation work.
									Without the hassle of coding it in to test.
									


IMGUI raw binding 					(not .dll :D )	Needs porting in, Todo once a laptop is sorted.	

							
									
		Oddities :-
		
Multi-player mode 1~3 players? 		LAN (Wifi,Cat5)and VPN only. Could be implemented, Internet play? 
									iffy on a good idea as it means exposing a port. Should be interesting on PIs.
									Gamepad usb support, easy to code implement. open source OS. cheap hardware.
									Nifty little games console. :)
									
		
Multi-player plugin					It exists no idea if it supports 1.8.1 though.


		Decided :-
		
Tempted to make this like diablo 2,torchlight 2.
Heavy use of 2d images, with only 3d characters / mobs / pawns / (buildings- Culled faces.)
Scenery can be 2d, Camera locked z/y/x/pitch/yaw with isometric view.
		Example :-

Light source without shadows. 

Prop candle (light source) in an empty room. attach a small .png picture to all faces in the room.
the closer to the light the higher the transparency until full (see through) further away transparency becomes dark.
add multiple pictures that cycle every 30 fps, but slightly altered to give the effect the candle is flickering.

"I have looked into the above, its achieved by render passes! .material script."

This effect is seen in the fresnel demo, for the roman bath. giving the illusion of the waters reflection on shiny tiles.
Even though its just a collection of small (30kb) 30 images played in a loop.

This saves costly calculations on static items, detailed shadows on player and NPC Pawns only.

I do have tight constraints. But nav nodes to different locations and loading will help with that.

All goes well you should be able to play this on a raspberry PI (Have one to test!! running debian) and i can play on my laptop :).
